now on Open Button [project>Open] you will see that i am working on it xD)


i will add the syntax on code editor


Maybe i will add and the events


and i will try to add your's compiler but i need to know first
if you have made the changes like the names that starts with A (AButton ,
ALabel,...etc) and if you made the read part of vb4a files and code files 


Also sorry for being so late with the end of
the IDE but i dont have free time unless Sat-Sand. because i have to read for
school and out-school lessons too much
