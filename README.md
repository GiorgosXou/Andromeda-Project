# About Me

My name is George Chousos or Giorgos_Xou i am 18 years old  
non-professional programmer since i was  14 years old,  
from Greece and i am the creator of the Andromeda IDE  
(one of the creators of "Project Andromeda").   

# IMPORTANT :P
Before you even judge my code please consider that:    

- 1) When i started building this IDE i was 16-17 years old.  

- 2) ALL MY KNOWLEDGE about programming and computer things was learned from INTERNET.  

- 3) At the age of 17 when i realised that my code was fucked up (lol) it was
     too late because i had to STUDY FOR MY FINAL EXAMS/ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS.  

- 4) I had that SMALL amount of free time that i even worked on IDE at 2-3am, when
     the next day i had to wake up for school at least at 7am.  
 
- 5) there is a story writen from "inside" of this code :') , story
     made out of passion and love for programming, days without sleep,
     days without being able to concentrate because i was thinking wtf
     was going on with some problems and etc.  

- 6) Arent those enough ? :3      


I am going to start fixing everything (as long as the code is fucked up lol) if  
i see that this project is going well and has support :3    
= For Now it ONLY supports a VB-like language
