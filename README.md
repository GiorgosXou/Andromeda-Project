#About Me

My name is George Chousos or Giorgos_Xou i am 18 years old<br/>
non-professional programmer since i was  14 years old, <br/>
from Greece and i am the creator of the Andromeda IDE. You can find me <br/>
on facebook here : /giorgos.xou.3 

#IMPORTANT :P
Before you even judge my code please consider that:<br/><br/>

' 1) When i started building this IDE i was 16-17 years old.<br/><br/>

' 2) ALL MY KNOWLEDGE about programming and computer things was learned from INTERNET.<br/><br/>

' 3) At the age of 17 when i realised that my code was fucked up (lol) it was <br/>
'    too late because i had to STUDY FOR MY FINAL EXAMS/ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS.<br/><br/>
'
' 4) I had that SMALL amount of free time that i even worked on IDE at 2-3pm, when<br/>
'    the next day i had to wake up for school at least at 7am.<br/><br/>
' 
' 5) there is a story writen from "inside" of this code :') , story<br/>
'    made out of passion and love for programming, days without sleep,<br/>
'    days without being able to concentrate because i was thinking wtf<br/>
'    was going on with some problems and etc.<br/><br/>
'
' 6) Arent those enough ? :3<br/><br/><br/>


I am going to start fixing everything (as long as the code is fucked up lol) if <br/>
i see that this project is going well and has support :3
